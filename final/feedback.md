**(-1) Merging (joining) on a column that isn't unique ends up applything the rows from one side of the joint to multiple rows on the other side.  It ends up duplicating rows.  For example, just merging on "age" when there are multiple rows for any age group**

**Overall, great work. You assignment flowed pretty well.**
